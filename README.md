Developed a customed tuned YOLOv8 model by using custom pothole dataset and further preprocessed data using data augmentation.
Further finetuned the hyperparameters of the model for improving accuracy of the model.
Interface for registering pothole complaints and verification of pothole filing for municipal corporation are established.
Established RTMP server for camera feed stream and UDP server for GPS coordinates.
Proper overview of the work progress is stimulated on website.
